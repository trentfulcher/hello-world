# hello-world
Initial set up for CIS-120

My name is Trent Fulcher and I have been married to my beautiful wife 
Ellen since October 21st, 2005.  On Halloween of last year, she gave
me the absolute best Halloween present ever, a beautiful baby boy
name Brady.  I work for Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, and am currently
taking Intro to Web Development as well as Intro to Programming.

Computers have always fascinated me, and I am looking to use my
previous computer knowledge in hardware/software, combined with 
my Computer Science degree I am currently pursuing to get into 
the IT career field in the next year.
